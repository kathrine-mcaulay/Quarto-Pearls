# Preface {.unnumbered}

This is a summary of some tips and tricks for using Quarto. It is a work in progress and I'll just be adding to it as and when things come up. The function is to capture the things that I forgot how to do and had to Google, plus new (to me) things as I learn them, to save time RE: repeated Googles in the future.

It's written from the perspective of using RStudio IDE on a Windows platform. Project was initiated with the following and using `{renv}`:

-   Quarto 1.4.551
-   RStudio 2023.12.1+402 "Ocean Storm"
-   Windows 10 Enterprise, Version	22H2
